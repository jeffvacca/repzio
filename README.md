## CODE TEST FOR REPZIO


### Notes:

* I used the out of the box Foundation accordion for mobile burger nav.
* The top fly-down “more" menu interaction is custom.
* I utilized Foundation’s Icon font and was able to do without the sprite entirely.
* The remaining images have been optimized for a significant reduction.
* The “To-Top” button has been enhanced to appear when the user scrolls past the header.  I chose to keep the button visible for all breakpoints.  The button is pure css.
* Added some subtle hover states to a few elements, including the logo.
* The main nav dropdown is pure css.

Overall, I took some liberties with the styling in keeping with the spirit of the project.  Thank you for taking the time to review my work.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts and that of your team.
